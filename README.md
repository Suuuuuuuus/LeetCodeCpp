LeetCodeCpp
=======================================

LeetCodeCpp contains my personal notes while learning C++. I'm aiming to put some algorithms in `SusAlgos` and
maintaining it as a static library (though only supporting M-series Mac at this moment). The `Codes` project 
contains some executables and unittests, which should reflect a coding convetion that either I'd like to learn,
or some interesting stuff that I'd like to recollect.
